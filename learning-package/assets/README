Put here any additional asset files that your app requires.

Asset files can be in any format your app can read. You should not put asset bundles (e.g. as ZIP files) in here.
Instead, you should replicate your desired asset file structure, including folders. In your learning-units.json file
you should then refer to individual files or folders by their relative path, with this folder considered the root.

For example, if you have the following structure:
```
shared/
shared/background.png
learning-unit-01/
learning-unit-01/sound.ogg
learning-unit-01/unit-asset.png
```
your learning-units.json file for learning-unit-01 should list "shared/background.png", "learning-unit-01/sound.ogg" and
"learning-unit-01/unit-asset.png" as additionalAssets. Alternatively, you can refer to a folder to define all contained
files as additional assets for your unit, e.g. "shared/", "learning-unit-01/".
