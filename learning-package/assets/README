Put here any additional assets that your app requires.
Asset files can be in any format your app can read. You should not put asset bundles (e.g. as ZIP files) in here.
Instead, you should replicate your desired asset file structure, including folders. In your units.json file,
you should then refer to individual files or folders by their relative path, with this folder considered the root.

For example, consider the following file structure:
```
shared/
shared/background.png
learning-unit-01/
learning-unit-01/sound.ogg
learning-unit-01/unit-asset.png
```
Then your units.json file for learning-unit-01 should list "shared/background.png", "learning-unit-01/sound.ogg" and
"learning-unit-01/unit-asset.png" as its `assets`. Alternatively, you can refer to a folder to make you unit require
all files it contains, e.g. "shared/", "learning-unit-01/".
